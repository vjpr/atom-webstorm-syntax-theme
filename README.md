# JetBrains WebStorm Default Light Syntax Theme for Atom

> A port of the default syntax theme from JetBrains Webstorm/IntelliJ IDEs.

Currently only tested for Javascript ES6/7.

## Recommended Packages

This package contains styles for these community packages:-

- [language-markdown](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown)
- [language-babel](https://github.com/gandm/language-babel)
  - This grammar allows much more fine-grain styling of ES6/7 Javascript.
  - NOTE: I don't use this plugin because it doesn't fully support Flow.
